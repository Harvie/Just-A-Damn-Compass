# NorthDog (0.1beta)
##### 3D Audio Compass for Android

 * This will play 3D sound so that it will appear to come from north
 * It's still in very early development stage
 * Based on https://github.com/jarofgreen/Just-A-Damn-Compass
 * Binaural audio mp3 files were generated using hrtf.py found at https://github.com/uncopenweb/3DSound

## TODO

 * Get published at F-Droid.org
 * Work in background, idealy with android sleeping or display turned off
 * Add possibility to set delay between sounds, so it does not drive you nuts if used for longer time period
 * Add possibility to measure distance (beep each 100 meters or kilometer?)
 * Make it possible to work without phone being flat to ground. Eg.: having phone in front pocket of the shirt would be useful for handsfree opration.
 * Generate 3D sound directly without need of manual preprocessing
