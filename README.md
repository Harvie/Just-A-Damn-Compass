# NorthDog (0.1beta)
##### 3D Audio Compass for Android

 * This will play 3D sound so that it will appear to come from north
 * It's still in very early development stage
 * Based on https://github.com/jarofgreen/Just-A-Damn-Compass
 * You need to generate binaural audio mp3 files using hrtf.py found at https://github.com/uncopenweb/3DSound
 * Put these files in /sdcard/kompas/dog3/a*.mp3
